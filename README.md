Livestock Management System console app using .NET Maui for App Development class, 2024.

In the LMS app, users can track livestock (cows and sheep) statistics. View financial information regarding profits, tax, and overall costs:

In summary, I really enjoyed this project. Seeing the database, coding, and visuals come together into a functional app was a great feeling! If I could start over, knowing what I now know after going through the entire process, there would be some changes I would make. However, I am overall happy with the functionality and accuracy of the calculations within the app.
